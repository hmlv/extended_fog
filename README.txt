This project is about an efficient graph computing method and programming model based on FOG(https://github.com/mrshawcode/fog).
I added a vertex-centric processing model in FOG, so it can support algorithms whose calculation does not meet the associative law.
This project also includes a task-based approach for finding strongly connected components.
